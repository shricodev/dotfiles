## ✨ Why Ansible?

Managing dotfiles and setting up a new system should be **fast**, **reliable**,
and **reproducible** — without needing to manually install a bunch of things
every time.

Ansible provides a **declarative**, **idempotent**, and **powerful** way to
automate:

- Installing system packages
- Configuring user environments
- Managing dotfiles
- Setting up development environments across **local machines**, **servers**,
  and even **containers**.

No more "setting up" — **just run the playbook and go!**

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, I had stow way of managing my dotfiles, you can find it in the other
> branch here: [Link](https://github.com/shricodev/dotfiles/tree/old-stow)

## 📽️ Demo

> You can find the demo video setting up this dotfiles configuration on multiple ubuntu homelabs here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXHfggMFbS0)

## 📦 Requirements

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) installed
- Git
- Supported Operating Systems (for now):
  - Arch Linux
  - Ubuntu (maybe also for Debian, but some packages names might be different)
- (Optional) Docker, if you want to test this in a container

## ⚡ Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you have `~/.local/bin` in your `$PATH` variable as that is
> where the Ansible will symlink all the `bin` scripts.

Run the setup script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shricodev/dotfiles/main/bin/dotfiles)"
```

> [!NOTE]
> This `bin/dotfiles` script will **auto-detect your OS**, **install Ansible**,
> **setup SSH keys**, and **run the main playbook** locally with the following.
> command: `ansible-playbook main.yml --limit local --ask-become-pass`

## 🚀 Usage

You can use the dotfiles script to setup everything **locally**.

The `dotfiles` script is supposed to only run locally, but if you want to configure
dotfiles on a remote machine, go for the [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) tasks instead.

Make sure you update the `inventory/hosts.yml` file with your hosts if you plan
to use it to setup multiple systems and not just localhost.

```yaml
---
all:
  children:
    ubuntu_homelabs:
      hosts:
        # <place_your_hosts_here>

    local:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local
```

Also, make sure that you update the `group_vars/local.yml`,
`group_vars/all.yml` and `ubuntu_homelabs.yml` (optional if you only plan to
run it locally) file to your liking.

### Using Taskfile tasks

First, make sure that you have `task` installed.

| Command                     | Description                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `task docker_build`         | Build the dotfiles Docker image              |
| `task docker_run`           | Run the dotfiles Docker container            |
| `task docker_build_and_run` | Build and run the dotfiles Docker container  |
| `task local`                | Run Ansible locally (your machine)           |
| `task ubuntu_homelabs`      | Run Ansible to setup Ubuntu homelab machines |

> [!NOTE]
> 🏁 PRO TIP: If you want to test the working without installing anything on your system,
> you can run the project in a docker container.

```bash
task docker_build_and_run
```

> [!NOTE]
> For running this to setup remote hosts, make sure you setup an SSH key to login
> to each of the individual remote hosts you plan to manage and place the name in the
> `ansible.cfg` file.

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = inventory/hosts.yml
private_key_file = <place_ssh_key_path_here>
roles_path = roles
retry_files_enabled = false

# Not the very best practice but this project just deals with local changes and
# mainly just the config changes, so shouldn't really matter.
host_key_checking = false
```

### Using the `dotfiles` script

You can use the `dotfiles` command **anywhere**:

```bash
bash dotfiles
```

> [!NOTE]
> Logs are stored in the `~/.dotfiles.log` file. Use it to debug any issues.

This will:

- Verify Ansible is installed
- Clone (or update) the dotfiles repository
- Install/update any `ansible-galaxy` dependencies
- Run the Ansible playbook with your configuration

## 🔥 First Run

After the first setup, a small file is created at `~/.dotfiles_first_run_check`
to detect that you ran it once.

On first run:

- SSH key for Ansible is automatically generated
- Dotfiles are cloned into `~/dotfiles`
- Playbooks configure your system
