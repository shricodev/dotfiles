    # NOTE: Always put fish, git at the end here when configuring dotfiles
    # because fish config sources different tools like starship, zoxide and all
    # that requires them to be installed first. and git config sets up ssh setup
    # for git, but ssh needs to be set up manually (what I prefer).
